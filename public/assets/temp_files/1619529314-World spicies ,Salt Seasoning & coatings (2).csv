Pre-heat the oven to 220°C/Fan 200°C/Gas Mark 7
Empty the contents into a mixing bowl, add 220ml of cold water and 2 medium eggs. Whisk thoroughly to form a smooth batter.
Add a little oil into each compartment of a 12 hole cupcake tray.
Place in the pre-heated oven and leave to heat until the oil is sizzling hot, between 5-10 minutes.
Confidently pour the batter evenly into the compartments and return to the oven.
Bake for 20-25 minutes (don’t open the oven door for the first 15 minutes) until well risen and golden.

Serve when cooked, then add a drop more oil to the pan to cook the next pancake.
