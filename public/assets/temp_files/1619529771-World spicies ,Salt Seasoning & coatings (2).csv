Heera Black Rock Salt (100g).

Heera Black Salt, also known as Kala Namak, is heated in heavy clay pots for many hours together with the precious ayurvedic Haritaki and Amla fruits. During this process, the salt absorbs the precious contents of the fruits and turns into salt crystals of reddish, brown colour and sulfureos smell.

Ayurvedic black salt is a great ingredient and supplement to all kinds of Asian foods, and used in the right dosage enhances the deliciousness of any dish!
